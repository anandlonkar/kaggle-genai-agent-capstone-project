    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Texas has a deregulated electricity market with over 100 providers and 2,000+ plan options. Consumers face:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complex Rate Structures**: Fixed-rate, time-of-use, free nights, EV charging plans\n",
    "2. **Usage Pattern Mismatch**: Most people don't know their actual consumption patterns\n",
    "3. **Cost Optimization Difficulty**: Calculating which plan saves money requires detailed analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: An AI agent system that:\n",
    "- Analyzes real smart meter data (kWh readings over 12 months)\n",
    "- Identifies usage characteristics (peak times, seasonal variation, weekend patterns)\n",
    "- Searches for specific Texas electricity plans with actual rates\n",
    "- Recommends 2-3 best-fit plans with cost estimates and reasoning\n",

    "### Key Design Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pre-Summarization Pattern**: \n",
    "   - Smart meter CSV has 2,190 records (~50,000 tokens)\n",
    "   - Analysis tool reduces this to ~500 tokens of insights\n",
    "   - Enables efficient LLM processing\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Agent-to-Agent Communication**:\n",
    "   - Power Plan Agent uses `AgentTool` to delegate web searches\n",
    "   - Search Agent specializes in finding electricity plan details\n",
    "   - Separation of concerns: orchestration vs. research\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Real Data Integration**:\n",
    "   - 5 household types with distinct patterns (GitHub-hosted CSVs)\n",
    "   - Actual Texas provider plans (TXU Energy, Reliant, Green Mountain)\n",
    "   - Production-ready tool design (easily adaptable to live APIs)\n",

    "   Use get_meter_readings to analyze the customer's consumption patterns:\n",
    "   - Overall statistics (average, median, max daily usage)\n",
    "   - Time-of-day patterns (4-hour interval breakdown)\n",

    "   - Seasonal trends (Winter/Spring/Summer/Fall)\n",
    "   - Usage consistency and variability\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **IDENTIFY OPTIMAL PLAN CHARACTERISTICS**\n",
    "   Based on usage analysis, determine what plan features would benefit this household:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **TIME-OF-USE PLANS** (if):\n",
    "   - Peak-to-off-peak ratio > 2.0x (concentrated usage during specific times)\n",
    "   - EV charging patterns (high usage midnight-4am)\n",
    "   - Flexible schedule (can shift usage to off-peak hours)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **FIXED-RATE PLANS** (if):\n",
    "   - Peak-to-off-peak ratio < 1.5x (consistent throughout day)\n",
    "   - Predictable, stable usage patterns\n",
    "   - Limited flexibility to shift consumption times\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **EV CHARGING PLANS** (if):\n",
    "   - Overnight charging pattern detected (>10 kWh during 00:00-04:00)\n",
    "   - Mention of electric vehicle\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **GREEN/RENEWABLE PLANS** (if):\n",
    "   - User explicitly mentions environmental concerns\n",
    "   - Willing to pay premium for renewable energy\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **SEASONAL/VARIABLE PLANS** (if):\n",
    "   - High seasonal variation (>2x between seasons)\n",
    "   - Unpredictable usage patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **EXTRACT OR REQUEST ZIP CODE**\n",
    "   - Check user query for ZIP code (5-digit format)\n",
    "   - If not provided, ask: \"To search for electricity plans, I need your ZIP code. What is your home ZIP code?\"\n",
    "   - Common Texas ZIP codes: 75035, 75074 (Plano/Frisco area)\n",

    "   Use search_agent to find specific plans matching the usage profile:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Example requests:**\n",
    "   - \"Search for EV electricity plans in ZIP code 75074\"\n",
    "   - \"Search for green time-of-use plans in ZIP 75035\"\n",
    "   - \"Search for fixed-rate plans in ZIP 75074\"\n",
    "   - \"Search for all plans in ZIP 75035\" (no filters)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Tips:**\n",
    "   - Be specific about ZIP code\n",
    "   - Include relevant classifications: \"ev\", \"green\", \"time_of_use\"\n",
    "   - Can combine filters: \"green EV plans\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **CALCULATE CUSTOMER-SPECIFIC COSTS**\n",
    "   Search agent returns costs at 3 standard tiers (500, 1000, 2000 kWh).\n",
    "   Calculate customer's actual expected monthly cost:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Method A - Direct match:**\n",
    "   If customer's monthly usage is close to a tier, use that tier's cost\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Method B - Interpolation:**\n",
    "   If between tiers, interpolate:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Customer uses X kWh/month (from: daily_avg × 30)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   If X is between 500-1000:\n",
    "     cost = cost_500 + ((X - 500) / 500) × (cost_1000 - cost_500)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   If X is between 1000-2000:\n",
    "     cost = cost_1000 + ((X - 1000) / 1000) × (cost_2000 - cost_1000)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   Customer: 24.3 kWh/day → 729 kWh/month\n",
    "   Plan costs: $99.72 @ 500 kWh, $199.49 @ 1000 kWh\n",
    "   Calculation: $99.72 + ((729-500)/500) × ($199.49-$99.72) = $145.55\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **PROVIDE DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS**\n",
    "   Present 2-3 top plans with comprehensive analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "   **For each plan include:**\n",
    "   - **Plan Name & Provider**: Full official names\n",
    "   - **Your Estimated Monthly Bill**: Calculated for their specific usage\n",
    "     (Show calculation: \"[daily_avg] kWh/day × 30 = [monthly] kWh → $[cost]\")\n",
    "   - **Rate Structure**: Explain pricing (fixed rate, time-of-use tiers, free hours)\n",
    "   - **Why This Fits**: Reference SPECIFIC usage data\n",
    "     Example: \"Your peak usage at 20:00-00:00 (X kWh) aligns with free night hours\"\n",
    "   - **Contract Terms**: Length, early termination fees, promotional periods\n",
    "   - **Features**: Renewable %, EV-friendly features, special benefits\n",
    "   - **Annual Savings**: Compare to baseline (typical 11.5¢/kWh average)\n",
    "   - **Cost Breakdown**: Show how total is calculated (base + energy + TDU + taxes)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **RANK RECOMMENDATIONS**\n",
    "   Order plans by best fit:\n",
    "   1. **Best Match**: Highest savings + best usage pattern alignment\n",
    "   2. **Runner-up**: Alternative with different trade-offs\n",
    "   3. **Budget Option**: Lowest cost (if different from #1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**\n",
    "- ALWAYS analyze meter data first (never skip this step)\n",
    "- MUST have ZIP code before searching (ask if missing)\n",
    "- Reference ACTUAL usage numbers in recommendations (be data-driven)\n",
    "- Show calculation steps for transparency\n",
    "- Use cost data from search_agent (don't estimate or guess)\n",
    "- Compare plans objectively based on customer's usage\n",
    "- Explain trade-offs clearly (e.g., \"Plan A saves more but requires 24-mo contract\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**EXAMPLE OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**\n",
